Description: 
Revelations was a school project that myself and three other students designed and coded. Only having one month to complete and with no prior game building experience, our team worked hard to create this tug-of-war 2D shooter and was awarded best game of the class. A 2 person, heaven vs hell combat simulation. Player one moves character with "WASD" and uses "space bar" to shoot. Player two uses "arrow keys" to move character and fires with "J". First player to kill the opponent enough times and destroy their base wins!
