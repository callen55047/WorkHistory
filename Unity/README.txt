Description:
The link above will direct you to a google drive folder to download the zip file containing the data and executable file. Extract the files and run the .exe file. Basic instructions will be shown on screen. The game was developed with the intention of using a controller as input (we tested with a PS4 controller). This simulation demonstrates my abilities in unity with character interaction, level and UI design, and basic story progression. This project was awarded best in the class and is still used to this day as an example of a near perfect score.
