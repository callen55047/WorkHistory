LocalSearchImprovement

Description: 
for an Artificial Intellegence course in my final year at TRU, I was tasked with building upon the idea of a path finding concept and improving its final result. Using a "local search" style approach, I wrote an algorithm that finds the end node in a 2-D grid, and then recursively searches for improvement until it has found what it believes to be the best path. For simplicity reasons, I've included all my javascript code in one file, and as an inline script on my html home page. 

how to: 
Open the file in any web browser of your choosing (I tested with google chrome). You will be presented with 3 inputs, a length output box labeled "path length", and 3 buttons. The input boxes allow you to change the size of the board, and the number of failed trials before it believes it has found the shortest path length. The button's will compute the initial path, generate a pre-made obstacle on the board, and search for an improved path, relatively speaking. Before you compute the initial path, you can click the squares on the board to create obstructions for the algorithm to find a path around.
